Genesis          1:  1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis          1:  2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
Genesis          1:  3  And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
Genesis          1:  4  God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis          1:  5  God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
Genesis          1:  6  And God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water."
Genesis          1:  7  So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
Genesis          1:  8  God called the vault "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
Genesis          1:  9  And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
Genesis          1: 10  God called the dry ground "land", and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.
Genesis          1: 11  Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.
Genesis          1: 12  The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis          1: 13  And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
Genesis          1: 14  And God said, "Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,
Genesis          1: 15  and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.
Genesis          1: 16  God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
Genesis          1: 17  God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,
Genesis          1: 18  to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis          1: 19  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
Genesis          1: 20  And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let the birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky."
Genesis          1: 21  So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis          1: 22  God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."
Genesis          1: 23  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
Genesis          1: 24  And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.
Genesis          1: 25  God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the living creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
Genesis          1: 26  Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wind animals,{ Probable reading of the original Hebrew text (see Syriac); Masoretic Text 'the earth' }
Genesis          1: 27  So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
Genesis          1: 28  God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground."
Genesis          1: 29  Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
Genesis          1: 30  And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food." And it was so.
Genesis          1: 31  God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
Genesis          2:  1  This the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
Genesis          2:  2  By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
Genesis          2:  3  Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
Genesis          2:  4  This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
Genesis          2:  5  Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth{ Or *land*; also in verse 6 } and no plant had yet sprung up, for the God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,
Genesis          2:  6  but streams{ Or *mist* } came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
Genesis          2:  7  Then the LORD God formed a man{ The Hebrew for *man (adam)* sounds like and may be related to the Hebrew for *ground (adamah)*; it is also the name *Adam* (see verse 20) } from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
Genesis          2:  8  Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.
Genesis          2:  9  The LORD God made all kinds of trees to grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis          2: 10  A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
Genesis          2: 11  The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
Genesis          2: 12  (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin{ Or *good; pearls* } and onyx are also there.)
Genesis          2: 13  The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.{ Possibly southeast Mesopotamia }
Genesis          2: 14  The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis          2: 15  The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
Genesis          2: 16  And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
Genesis          2: 17  but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."
Genesis          2: 18  The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
Genesis          2: 19  Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
Genesis          2: 20  So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam{ Or *the man* } no suitable helper was found.
Genesis          2: 21  So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs{ Or *took part of the man's side* } and then closed up the place with flesh.
Genesis          2: 22  Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib{ Or *part* } he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
Genesis          2: 23  The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."
Genesis          2: 24  That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.
Genesis          2: 25  Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
Genesis          3:  1  Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
Genesis          3:  2  The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
Genesis          3:  3  but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"
Genesis          3:  4  "You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman.
Genesis          3:  5  "For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
Genesis          3:  6  When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
Genesis          3:  7  Then the eyes of both them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
Genesis          3:  8  Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis          3:  9  But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"
Genesis          3: 10  He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
Genesis          3: 11  And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
Genesis          3: 12  The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
Genesis          3: 13  Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate it."
Genesis          3: 14  So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all livestock
Genesis          3: 15  And I will put emnity between you and the woman, and between your offspring{ Or *seed* } and hers; he will crush{ Or *strike* } your head, and you will strike his heel."
Genesis          3: 16  To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
Genesis          3: 17  To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.
Genesis          3: 18  It will produce throns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
Genesis          3: 19  By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust your are and to dust you will return."
Genesis          3: 20  Adam{ Or *the man* } named his wife Eve,{ *Eve* probably means *living*. } because she would become the mother of all the living.
Genesis          3: 21  The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
Genesis          3: 22  And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
Genesis          3: 23  So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
Genesis          3: 24  After he drove out the man out, he placed on the east side{ Or *placed in front* } of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
Genesis          4:  1  Adam{ Or *The man* } made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.{ *Cain* sounds like the Hebrew for *brought forth* or *acquired*. } She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth{ Or *have acquired* } a man."
Genesis          4:  2  Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soul.
Genesis          4:  3  In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.
Genesis          4:  4  And Abel also brought an offering—fat poritions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
Genesis          4:  5  but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
Genesis          4:  6  Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
Genesis          4:  7  If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."
Genesis          4:  8  Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field."{ Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Masoretic Text does not have *"Let's go out to the field"* } While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
Genesis          4:  9  Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"
Genesis          4: 10  The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.
Genesis          4: 11  Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hands.
Genesis          4: 12  When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
Genesis          4: 13  Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is more than I can bear.
Genesis          4: 14  Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
Genesis          4: 15  But the LORD said to him, "Not so{ Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew *Very well* }; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
Genesis          4: 16  So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod,{ *Nod* means *wandering* (see verses 12 and 14). } east of Eden.
Genesis          4: 17  Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.
Genesis          4: 18  To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
Genesis          4: 19  Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
Genesis          4: 20  Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestocks.
Genesis          4: 21  His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.
Genesis          4: 22  Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of{ Or *who instructed all who work in* } bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.
Genesis          4: 23  Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
Genesis          4: 24  If Cain is avenged sevent times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
Genesis          4: 25  Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,{ *Seth* probably means *granted* } saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
Genesis          4: 26  Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on{ Or *to proclaim* } the name of the LORD.
Genesis          5:  1  This is the written account of Adam's family line. When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
Genesis          5:  2  He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them "Mankind"{ Hebrew *adam* } when they were created.
Genesis          5:  3  When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.
Genesis          5:  4  After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis          5:  5  Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.

Genesis          5: 18  When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.
Genesis          5: 19  After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis          5: 20  Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
Genesis          5: 21  When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
Genesis          5: 22  After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
Genesis          5: 23  Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
Genesis          5: 24  Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.
Genesis          5: 25  When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.

Genesis          6:  1  When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,
Genesis          6:  2  the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.
Genesis          6:  3  Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with{ Or *My spirit will not remain in* } humans forever, for they are mortal{ Or *corrupt* }; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."
Genesis          6:  4  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
Genesis          6:  5  The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.
Genesis          6:  6  The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.
Genesis          6:  7  So the LORD said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have ever made them."
Genesis          6:  8  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis          6:  9  This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.
Genesis          6: 10  Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
Genesis          6: 11  Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.
Genesis          6: 12  God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
Genesis          6: 13  So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence becasue of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
Genesis          6: 14  So make yourself an ark of cypress{ The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain. } wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
Genesis          6: 15  This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.{ That is, about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 135 meters long, 23 meters wide and 14 meters high }
Genesis          6: 16  Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit{ That is, about 18 inches or about 45 cm } high all around.{ The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain. } Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle, and upper decks.
Genesis          6: 17  I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.
Genesis          6: 18  But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis          6: 19  You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
Genesis          6: 20  Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
Genesis          6: 21  You are to take every kind of good that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."
Genesis          6: 22  Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
Genesis          7:  1  The LORD then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you rightous in this generation.
Genesis          7:  2  Take with you seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,
Genesis          7:  3  and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
Genesis          7:  4  Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."
Genesis          7:  5  And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.
Genesis          7:  6  Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
Genesis          7:  7  And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Genesis          7:  8  Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,
Genesis          7:  9  male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.
Genesis          7: 10  And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
Genesis          7: 11  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst fourth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
Genesis          7: 12  And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. 
Genesis          7: 13  On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
Genesis          7: 14  They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.
Genesis          7: 15  Pairs of creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
Genesis          7: 16  The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
Genesis          7: 17  For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.
Genesis          7: 18  The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
Genesis          7: 19  They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
Genesis          7: 20  The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.{ That is, about 23 feet or about 6.8 meters }{ Or *rose more than fifteen cubits, and the mountains were covered* }
Genesis          7: 21  Every living thing that moved onto land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
Genesis          7: 22  Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Genesis          7: 23  Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that moved along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
Genesis          7: 24  The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
Genesis          8:  1  But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.
Genesis          8:  2  Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.
Genesis          8:  3  The water receded stadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,
Genesis          8:  4  and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis          8:  5  The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
Genesis          8:  6  After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark
Genesis          8:  7  and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.
Genesis          8:  8  Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
Genesis          8:  9  But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
Genesis          8: 10  He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
Genesis          8: 11  When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
Genesis          8: 12  He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.
Genesis          8: 13  By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
Genesis          8: 14  By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
Genesis          8: 15  Then God said to Noah,
Genesis          8: 16  "Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
Genesis          8: 17  Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it."
Genesis          8: 18  So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
Genesis          8: 19  All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another.
Genesis          8: 20  Then Noah built an alter to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
Genesis          8: 21  The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though{ Or *humans, for* } every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.
Genesis          8: 22  "As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."
Genesis          9:  1  Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.
Genesis          9:  2  The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.
Genesis          9:  3  Everything hat lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
Genesis          9:  4  "But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
Genesis          9:  5  And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animals. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.
Genesis          9:  6  "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind.
Genesis          9:  7  As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it."
Genesis          9:  8  Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
Genesis          9:  9  "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
Genesis          9: 10  and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on the earth.
Genesis          9: 11  I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."
Genesis          9: 12  And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
Genesis          9: 13  I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
Genesis          9: 14  Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
Genesis          9: 15  I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
Genesis          9: 16  Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
Genesis          9: 17  So God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."
Genesis          9: 18  The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
Genesis          9: 19  These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.
Genesis          9: 20  Noah, a man of the soil. proceeded{ Or *soil, was the first* } to plant a vineyard.
Genesis          9: 21  When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.
Genesis          9: 22  Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
Genesis          9: 23  But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father's naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked.
Genesis          9: 24  When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,
Genesis          9: 25  he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers."
Genesis          9: 26  He also said, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
Genesis          9: 27  May God extend Japheth's{ *Japheth* sounds like the Hebrew for *extend* } territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth."
Genesis          9: 28  After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
Genesis          9: 29  Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
Genesis         10:  1  This is the account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah's sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.
Genesis         10:  2  The sons{ *Sons* may mean *descendants* or *successors* or *nations*; also in verses 3, 4, 6, 7, 20-23, 29 and 31. } of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.

Genesis         10:  7  The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
Genesis         10:  8  Cush was the father{ *Father* may mean *ancestor* or *predecessor* or *founder*; also in verses 13, 15, 24 and 26. } of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.
Genesis         10:  9  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty warrior hunter before the LORD."
Genesis         10: 10  The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkadand Kalneh, in{ Or *Uruk and Akkad—all of them in* } Shinar.{ That is, Babylonia }
Genesis         10: 11  From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,{ Or *Nineveh with its city squares* } Calah
Genesis         10: 12  and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.

Genesis         10: 17  Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
Genesis         10: 18  Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered
Genesis         10: 19  and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.
Genesis         10: 20  These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.   
Genesis         10: 21  Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was{ Or *Shem, the older brother of* } Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.

Genesis         10: 25  Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg,{ *Peleg* means *division* } because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.

Genesis         10: 32  These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
Genesis         11:  1  Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
Genesis         11:  2  As people moved eastward,{ Or *from the east*; or *in the east* } they found a plain in Shinar{ That is, Babylonia } and settled there.
Genesis         11:  3  They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
Genesis         11:  4  Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole."
Genesis         11:  5  But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
Genesis         11:  6  The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
Genesis         11:  7  Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."
Genesis         11:  8  So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
Genesis         11:  9  That is why it was called Babel{ That is, Babylon; *Babel* sounds like the Hebrew for *confused*. }—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole world.
Genesis         11: 10  This is the account of Shem's family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father{ *Father* may mean *ancestor*; also in verses 11-25. } of Arphaxad.

Genesis         11: 28  While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.
Genesis         11: 29  Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife is Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah.
Genesis         11: 30  Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive.
Genesis         11: 31  Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there.

Esther           8:  9  At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.{ That is, the upper Nile region. } These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language.
Esther          10:  3
Job              1:  1  In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
Job              1:  2  He had seven sons and three daughters,
Job              1:  3  and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
Job              1:  4  His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
Job              1:  5  When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
Job              1:  6  One day the angels{ Hebrew *the sons of God* } came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan{ Hebrew *satan means adversary*. } also came with them.
Job              1:  7  The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."
Job              1:  8  Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
Job              1:  9  "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
Job              1: 10  "Have you not put a hedge of protection around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
Job              1: 11  But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
Job              1: 12  The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
Job              1: 13  One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
Job              1: 14  a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
Job              1: 15  and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put your servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
Job              1: 16  While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
Job              1: 17  While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
Job              1: 18  While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
Job              1: 19  when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
Job              1: 20  At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
Job              1: 21  and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart.{ Or *will return there* } The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
Job              1: 22  In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
Job              2:  1  On another day the angels{ Hebrew *the sons of God* } came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
Job              2:  2  And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."
Job              2:  3  Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
Job              2:  4  "Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give his all he has for his own life.
Job              2:  5  But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
Job              2:  6  The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
Job              2:  7  So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
Job              2:  8  Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
Job              2:  9  His wife said to him, "Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!"
Job              2: 10  He replied, "You are talking like a foolish{ The Hebrew word rendered *foolish* denotes moral deficiency. } woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
Job              2: 11  When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
Job              2: 12  When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
Job              2: 13  Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
Job              3:  1  After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job              3:  2  He said:
Job              3:  3  "May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, 'A boy is conceived!'
Job              3:  4  That day—may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it.
Job              3:  5  May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it.
Job              3:  6  That night—may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
Job              3:  7  May that night be barren; may no shout of joy he heard in it.
Job              3:  8  May those who curse days{ Or *curse the sea* } curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
Job              3:  9  May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
Job              3: 10  for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide the trouble from my eyes.
Job              3: 11  "Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
Job              3: 12  Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
Job              3: 13  For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
Job              3: 14  with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
Job              3: 15  with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
Job              3: 16  Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
Job              3: 17  There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
Job              3: 18  Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
Job              3: 19  The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners.
Job              3: 20  "Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
Job              3: 21  to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
Job              3: 22  who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
Job              3: 23  Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
Job              3: 24  For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water.
Job              3: 25  What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
Job              3: 26  I have no place, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
Job              4:  1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
Job              4:  2  "If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep you from speaking?
Job              4:  3  Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
Job              4:  4  Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
Job              4:  5  But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
Job              4:  6  Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
Job              4:  7  "Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
Job              4:  8  As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
Job              4:  9  At the breath of God they perish; at the blast of his anger they are no more.
Job              4: 10  The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
Job              4: 11  The lion perishes for the lack of prey, and the clubs of the lioness are scattered.
Job              4: 12  "A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
Job              4: 13  Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on people,
Job              4: 14  fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
Job              4: 15  A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
Job              4: 16  It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:
Job              4: 17  'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
Job              4: 18  If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
Job              4: 19  how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
Job              4: 20  Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
Job              4: 21  Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'
Job              5:  1  "Call if you want, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
Job              5:  2  Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
Job              5:  3  I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
Job              5:  4  His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
Job              5:  5  The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
Job              5:  6  For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
Job              5:  7  Yet man is born to trouble, as surely as sparks fly upward.
Job              5:  8  "But if I were you, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
Job              5:  9  He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
Job              5: 10  He provides rain for the earth; he sends water on the countryside.
Job              5: 11  The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
Job              5: 12  He twarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
Job              5: 13  He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
Job              5: 14  Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
Job              5: 15  He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
Job              5: 16  So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
Job              5: 17  "Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.{ Hebrew Shaddai*; here and throughout Job }
Job              5: 18  For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
Job              5: 19  From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will touch you.
Job              5: 20  In famine he will deliver you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
Job              5: 21  You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
Job              5: 22  You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the wild animals.
Job              5: 23  For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
Job              5: 24  You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
Job              5: 25  You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
Job              5: 26  You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
Job              5: 27  "We have examined this, and its true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."
Job              6:  1  Then Job replied:
Job              6:  2  "If only my anguish could we weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
Job              6:  3  It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas—no wonder my words have been impetuous.
Job              6:  4  The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.
Job              6:  5  Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
Job              6:  6  Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is the flavor in the sap of teh mallow{ The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. }?
Job              6:  7  I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
Job              6:  8  "Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope,
Job              6:  9  that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut off my life!
Job              6: 10  Then I would still have this consolation—my joy in unrelenting pain—that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job              6: 11  "What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
Job              6: 12  Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
Job              6: 13  Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?
Job              6: 14  "Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
Job              6: 15  But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
Job              6: 16  when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
Job              6: 17  but that stop flowing in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
Job              6: 18  Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go off into the wasteland and perish.
Job              6: 19  The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
Job              6: 20  They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
Job              6: 21  Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
Job              6: 22  Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
Job              6: 23  deliver me from the hand of the enemy, rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless'?
Job              6: 24  "Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
Job              6: 25  How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
Job              6: 26  Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat my desperate words as wind?
Job              6: 27  You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
Job              6: 28  "But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
Job              6: 29  Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.{ Or *my rightousness still stands* }
Job              6: 30  Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?
Job              7:  1  "Do not mortals have hard service on earth? Are not their days like those of hired laborers?
Job              7:  2  Like a slave longing for the evening shower, or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,
Job              7:  3  so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
Job              7:  4  When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.

Job              7: 13  When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
Job              7: 14  even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
Job              7: 15  so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
Job              7: 16  I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
Job              7: 17  "What is mankind that you make so much of them, that you give them so much attention,

Job              7: 19  Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
Job              7: 20  If I have sinned, what have I done to you, you who see everything we do? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?{ A few manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition and Septuagint; most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text *I have become a burden to myself* }
Job              7: 21  Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."
Job              8:  1  Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

Job              8: 14  What they trust in is fragile{ The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain. }; what they rely on is a spider's web.
Job              8: 15  They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold.
Job              8: 16  They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
Job              8: 17  it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
Job              8: 18  But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'

Job              8: 22  Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
Job              9:  1  Then Job replied:
Job              9:  2  "Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?

Job              9: 14  "How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
Job              9: 15  Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
Job              9: 16  Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
Job              9: 17  He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
Job              9: 18  He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
Job              9: 19  If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him{ See Seputuagint; Hebrew *me*. }?

Job              9: 21  "Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.

Job              9: 29  Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
Job              9: 30  Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with cleansing powder,
Job              9: 31  you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
Job              9: 32  "He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
Job              9: 33  If only there were someone to mediate between us, someone to bring us together,
Job              9: 34  someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
Job              9: 35  Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.

Job             10:  5  Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a strong man,
Job             10:  6  that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin—
Job             10:  7  though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
Job             10:  8  "Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
Job             10:  9  Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
Job             10: 10  Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,
Job             10: 11  clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
Job             10: 12  You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.
Job             10: 13  "But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:
Job             10: 14  If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.
Job             10: 15  If I am guilty—woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in{ Or *and aware of* } my affliction.
Job             10: 16  If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.

Job             10: 22  to the land of the deepest night, of utter darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."
Job             11:  1  Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
Job             11:  2  "Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?

Job             11:  4  You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'
Job             11:  5  Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you

Job             11: 15  then, free of fault, you will lift up your face;

Proverbs         1:  1  The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs         1:  2  for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight;
Proverbs         1:  3  for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair;
Proverbs         1:  4  for giving prudence to those who are simple,{ The Hebrew word rendered 'simple' in Proverbs denotes a person who is gullible, without moral direction and inclined to evil. }
Proverbs         1:  5  let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance—
Proverbs         1:  6  for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.{ Or 'understanding a proverb, namely, a parable, / and the sayngs of the wise, their riddles }
Proverbs         1:  7  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools{ The Hebrew words rendered 'fool' in Proverbs, and often elsewhere in the Old Testament, denote a person who is morally deficient. } despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs         1:  8  Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
Proverbs         1:  9  They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.
Proverbs         1: 10  My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them.
Proverbs         1: 11  If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for innocent blood, let's ambush some harmless soul;
Proverbs         1: 12  let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
Proverbs         1: 13  we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;
Proverbs         1: 14  cast lots with us; we will all share the loot"—
Proverbs         1: 15  my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;
Proverbs         1: 16  for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood.
Proverbs         1: 17  How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it!
Proverbs         1: 18  These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves!
Proverbs         1: 19  Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it.
Proverbs         1: 20  Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square;
Proverbs         1: 21  on top of the wall{} she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech:
Proverbs         1: 22  "How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs         1: 23  Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings.
Proverbs         1: 24  But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
Proverbs         1: 25  since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke,
Proverbs         1: 26  I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
Proverbs         1: 27  when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.
Proverbs         1: 28  "Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me,
Proverbs         1: 29  since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD.
Proverbs         1: 30  Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
Proverbs         1: 31  they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
Proverbs         1: 32  For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
Proverbs         1: 33  but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."
